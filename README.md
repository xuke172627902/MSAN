# MSAN
models and codes for Multi-scale strip-shaped convolution attention network for lightweight image super-resolution (MSAN)
The code is constructed based on BasicSR. Before any testing or reproducing, make sure the installation and the datasets preparation are done correctly.
To keep the workspace clean and simple, only test.py, train.py and your_arch.py are needed here and then you are good to go.
